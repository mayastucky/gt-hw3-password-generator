# gt-hw3-password-generator

## Description

This program takes a user's desired password length and criteria and outputs a randomized and secure password for protecting themselves and their information.

## Installation

Clone the repo and run the index.html in your browser.

## Usage

This application is perfect for those who need to secure their information with an array (haha!) of different and secure passwords. Once you open the app, click on the button to have the browser prompt you to select your desired length (8-128 characters) and select at least one character type. You will then be alerted with your secure password.

## Credits

This was a solo project completed as homework for the Georgia Tech Full-Stack Flex Program. As always, many thanks to my peers who are always willing to work out the kinks together.
